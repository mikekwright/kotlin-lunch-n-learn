## Kotlin History

Kotlin is a new language created by Jetbrains. A company out of Saint Petersburg,
Russia.    

The name `Kotlin` actually comes from the name of a small island near that 
location. 

Was first introduced as an upcoming language in 2011.  It was meant to compile as
fast as java.  

note:  

The created of the language was Dmitry Jemerov, and he basically said that other 
language didn't have the features that he was looking for, other than scala. But the 
slow compile time of scala was a big issue.
